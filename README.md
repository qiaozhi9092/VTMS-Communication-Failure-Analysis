# VTMS-Communication-Failure-Analysis
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) is concerned about the number of network communication failures with its Variable Toll Message Signs (VTMS) on the I-680 Express Lanes Corridor, which degrades the overall performance of the sign.  MTC would like the Express Lanes Data Analyst to analyze and document the scope of the problem.
